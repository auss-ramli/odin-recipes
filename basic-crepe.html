        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>

                In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine.
                 Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately
                1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.        
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
                Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
