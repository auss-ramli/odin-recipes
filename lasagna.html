            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat
                until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with 
                sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.
                 Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to aboil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                 Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, around 
                 top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil; to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure
                  the foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
