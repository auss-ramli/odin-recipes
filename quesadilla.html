                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is completely browned,
                 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir tomato sauce, black beans, diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro, corn, and chopped
                 green chiles into the ground beef mixture; season with chilli powder, cumin, garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to low and cook mixture at a simmer for 5 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread about 1/2 cup beef mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with 3 tortillas, overlapping as needed.
                Spread another 1/2 cup beef mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle 1 cup Cheddar cheese over beef. Finish with layers of remaining tortillas, beef mixture, and Cheddar cheese, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until heated throughout and the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.</li>
